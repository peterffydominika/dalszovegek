I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please<br>
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)<br>
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start<br>
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart<br>
<br>
Oh, whoa, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh oh<br>
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got<br>

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be (hey)<br>
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me (I love it)<br>
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun<br>
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun (fun)<br>
<br>
Oh, whoa, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh oh<br>
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got<br>

I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you<br>
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin<br>
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'<br>
Just like a chick in the casino<br>
Take your bank before I pay you out<br>
I promise this, promise this<br>
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous<br>
